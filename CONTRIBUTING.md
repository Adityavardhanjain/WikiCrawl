## Before You Start

Before making a contribution:

1. Check the existing issues and pull requests.
2. Search the repository to make sure the problem or feature hasn't already been addressed.
3. For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss the proposed approach.

# Development Workflow

A typical contribution workflow looks like this:

```text
Fork
  ↓
Clone
  ↓
Create branch
  ↓
Make changes
  ↓
Run tests / checks
  ↓
Review changes
  ↓
Commit
  ↓
Push
  ↓
Open Pull Request
```

Create a feature branch rather than working directly on `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

For bug fixes:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-name
```

For documentation:

```bash
git checkout -b docs/your-change
```

# Project Guidelines

WikiCrawl is primarily an exploration tool. Contributions should preserve the core experience of discovering connections between topics.

When making changes, consider:

### Performance

WikiCrawl can generate large graphs.

Avoid introducing unnecessary:

- Network requests
- Re-renders
- Data processing
- Memory usage
- Client-side computation

If a change affects graph generation or rendering performance, test it with larger graphs as well as small ones.

### Reliability

Crawler failures should be handled gracefully.

Prefer:

- Clear error states
- Useful user feedback
- Defensive handling of unexpected data
- Graceful handling of unavailable Wikipedia pages
- Safe handling of malformed or incomplete responses

Avoid silently failing operations where the user would have no indication of what happened.

### Backward Compatibility

Do not unnecessarily break existing functionality.

If a change requires modifying an existing API, data structure, or behavior, explain the reason and impact in the pull request.

---

# UI and UX Guidelines

WikiCrawl's interface is intentionally designed around exploration.

Contributions to the UI should prioritize:

1. **Clarity**
2. **Speed**
3. **Discoverability**
4. **Accessibility**
5. **Consistency**
6. **Responsiveness**

The interface should remain easy to understand even as the graph becomes more complex.

### Avoid Unnecessary UI Complexity

Do not add UI elements simply because they look interesting.

Every interaction should have a clear purpose.

### Preserve Graph Exploration

Changes should not make it harder for users to:

- Understand the graph
- Select nodes
- Explore relationships
- Read article information
- Navigate between states
- Return from an opened node or panel

### Mobile Matters

Any UI contribution should be tested on smaller screens.

A feature that works on desktop but makes the application difficult to use on mobile is not considered complete.

### Accessibility

Where applicable:

- Use semantic HTML
- Provide accessible labels
- Maintain keyboard navigation
- Ensure interactive elements are discoverable
- Avoid relying solely on color to communicate information
- Consider reduced-motion preferences

---

# Code Guidelines

Follow the existing conventions in the repository.

Prefer:

- Small, focused components
- Reusable utilities
- Clear naming
- Simple control flow
- Explicit error handling
- Minimal duplication

Avoid:

- Large unrelated refactors
- Dead code
- Unused dependencies
- Unnecessary abstractions
- Hardcoded secrets
- Debugging statements in production code

Before committing, remove temporary debugging code such as:

```javascript
console.log(...)
```

unless it is intentionally part of the application's behavior.

---

# Dependencies

Do not add a dependency for functionality that can reasonably be implemented using the existing stack.

If you believe a new dependency is necessary:

1. Explain why it is needed.
2. Consider its bundle size and maintenance status.
3. Check whether the existing project already provides equivalent functionality.
4. Mention the dependency in the pull request.

---

# Commit Messages

Keep commit messages short and descriptive.

Good examples:

```text
fix: improve mobile node navigation
```

```text
feat: add relationship details to graph nodes
```

```text
perf: reduce unnecessary graph re-renders
```

```text
docs: improve local development instructions
```

```text
fix: handle failed Wikipedia requests
```

Avoid vague messages such as:

```text
update
```

```text
changes
```

```text
fixed stuff
```

```text
final
```

---

# Pull Requests

Before opening a pull request, make sure:

- [ ] The application runs locally
- [ ] The change works as intended
- [ ] Existing functionality still works
- [ ] Tests/checks pass, where applicable
- [ ] No secrets or credentials were committed

### Why?

Explain the problem the change solves or the motivation behind it.

### How was it tested?

Describe the testing you performed.

For UI changes, screenshots or short recordings are highly encouraged.

### Example

```markdown
## What changed?

Improved the node details panel so users can better understand how
the selected article connects to neighboring nodes.

## Why?

Users could see that nodes were connected but had limited information
about the relationship between them.

## Testing

- Tested locally with small graphs

# Feature Requests

Before proposing a feature, consider whether it improves the core WikiCrawl experience.

A good feature request should explain:

- What problem does this solve?
- Who benefits from it?
- How would the feature work?
- Why is the current behavior insufficient?
- Are there alternative approaches?

Please avoid proposing features solely because they are technically interesting.

WikiCrawl should remain focused on **knowledge exploration through connected information**.

---

# Questions and Discussions

If you're unsure about an implementation, open an issue or discussion before investing significant time in a large change.

For larger architectural changes, early discussion is strongly preferred.

This helps avoid situations where significant work has been completed around an approach that doesn't fit the project's direction.

---

# Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive.

Contributors are expected to:

- Treat others with respect
- Give constructive feedback
- Assume good intentions
- Keep discussions relevant
- Avoid harassment or discriminatory behavior

Disagreements about implementation are normal. Keep technical discussions focused on the problem and the proposed solution.
